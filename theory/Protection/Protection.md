One of the duties of the OS is to protect the hardware and software resources of a PC.
An OS, in facts has to define both [[#Protection mechanisms|mechanisms]] and [[#Protection politics|politics]] to check and regulate the access to all the resources it manages.
User, clients, processes and programs need to be controlled when accessing every kind of data, device, program or information.

#### Protection politics
Politics define the kind of protection the system needs, which resources need the most regulations and how to regulate the access to these resources.
#### Protection mechanisms
They define the practical methods to implement protection politics.


## Subdivisions
We can divide the protection in more sub-aspects:
- [[Protection Objectives]];
- [[Protections Domain]];
- [[Access Control Matrix]];
