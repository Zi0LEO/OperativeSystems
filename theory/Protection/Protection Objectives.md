A system consists in a set of hardware components(CPU, memory, mouse) and a set of software components(programs, files, compilers).

Each of these objects is represented in the OS by an individual identifier, and can be accessed with a set of well defined operations.

To protect these components means to allow them to be used only via the set of operations that they implement, and only by the client that has the permission to do so.
