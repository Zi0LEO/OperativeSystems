The swap space is essential for the implementation of [[Virtual Memory]]. In facts, since the virtual memory is way bigger than the physical memory, most of the data needed and ready to be swapped in are located in mass memory.
There are two ways to make this:
- Using the same space allocated to the [[File System Implementation|file system]] (less efficient);
- Using a different partition than the file system.
