#### Dynamic loading
Dynamic loading allows to load routines in memory only when they are called, this optimizes central memory's usage, since never used routines are not loaded in memory.

#### Dynamic binding
Dynamic biding is needed to use common code parts shared between programs. This binding occurs at run time.
An essential role in this process is done by [[Stub Code]], useful, in this case, to locate the needed routine, that will later substitute it at run time.
