The choice of the implementation of directories has a huge impact on the efficiency and reliability of the file system.
Two methods are possible:
- **Linear list**:
	- Easiest implementation;
	- Not efficient when searching(O(n))
- Hash Table:
	- Faster search time;
	- Dimension functional to hash function;
	- Implements collision handling.
